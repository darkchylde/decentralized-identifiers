# Decentralized identifiers


* Verifiable
* Decentralized
* Can represent anything (decided by the controller)
* Controller can prove ownership without any other party involved
* DIDs are URLs that associate a DID subject with a DID document


## DID document

* Cryptographic material, service endpoints, verification methods
* Service endpoints enable trusted interactions associated with a subject
* Can contain semantics about a DID subject or may be the document itself (a data model)

* Anyone can generate DIDs for their usecase
* Specification for a type of DID is called DID method

## DID structure

* A simple string containing 3 parts
	a. URL scheme identifier (did)
	b. Method identifier (for e.g. sov, eth, jlinc)
	c. Method specific identifier ( So far, I understand this as a random string, maybe UUID)
* This string resolved to a DID document. This is similar to website url resolving to the website content

## What is being achieved with DID ?

* Decentralization
	1. Eliminate single point of failure
* Control
	1. You can control your own DIDs (no external parties required for e.g. On contrary for a www domain name it is controlled by domain name registrar)
* Privacy
	1. Data minimisation 
	2. Control the amount of information disclosed
* Security
	1. As defined in DID document (Didn't really understand how this works so far !)
* Proof based
	1. Controllers will be able to provide proof to other parties if required
* Discoverability
	1. DID of one entity can lead you to DID of other entity (Maybe DID document will DID of other entity)
* Interoperatibility
	1. Should be capable of working with existing systems
* Portability
	1. A DID should be able to work with any system that support DIDs and DID methods
	2. for e.g. jlinc DID must be able to work with sovrin DID (Is this achieved already ?)
	3. Is portability achieved through resolvers ??
* Simplicity
* Extensibility
